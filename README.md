# Using the App

### Usage
1. Enter full system path to the directory of photos you wish to edit in the text box in the header, then press Enter
2. All JPG and/or PNG images will load into the list on the side bar
3. Select a photo from the list to view the photo, a map of where it was taken, and the photo metadata
4. Edit the metadata fields as needed, these fields include:
    - Date: Local date from when the photo was taken
    - Time: Local time from when the photo was taken - *NOT UTC Time*
    - Timezone Offset: The timezone offset between the local time and UTC time
        * (e.g. Hawaii offset is -10 hours, and it is written as *-10:00* using `+/-HH:MM` notation)
    - Elevation: Elevation in meters of where photo was taken (negative or positive, including decimal values)
    - Latitude: GPS latitude of where the photo was taken
    - Longitude: GPS longitude of where the photo was taken
6. Click 'Save' to save the metadata

Tip 1: Click the search icon next to timezone offset field to calculate timezone offset based on the GPS and date/time information

Tip 2: You can either click on the map itself to select new coordinates, or enter them manually in the text boxes

Tip 3: You can paste coordinates in decimal degrees format "latitude, longitude" in either the latitude or longitude fields, and the app will automatically detect this and populate both coordinates values for you automatically

Tip 4: You can disable warnings, or change to dark mode in the options menu (top left corner)
